# rasterIntro
A brief introduction to raster datasets in R

## Intent
The language and methods we commonly employ for geospatial data are unusual and often confusing, especially for beginners. It was my intention to create a small series of R scripts that would introduce users to basic raster concepts and functions, in addition to illustrate some common problems you may run into when dealing with these kinds of datasets.

## Presentation
A basic (visual) introduction to rasters can be found in the pdf presentation (`introToRasters.pdf`). Please note that much of the imagery in the pdf was not generated by me, and should not be used without citation of the original provider.

## Scripts
The code in this repository is currently broken into 3 scripts. The first (`000_IntroToRasters.R`) introduces basic raster concepts and gets the user started with downloading, manipulating, and wrangling raster data. The second (`001_CreatingRasters.R`) explains how to create a raster dataset from scratch, using random made-up data. The principles in this script can be employed with other from-scratch raster generation problems. The third and final script (`002_ReprojectingIssues.R`) illustrates how reprojecting raster datasets results in a loss of information, and how after many reprojections the original form of the data may be completely lost.
